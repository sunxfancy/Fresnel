Fresnel 
=============================


Fresnel is a simple C interface render engine focusing on performance with traditional/modern ray-tracing pipeline support. 
It's aimed to be user-friendly and flexible to change your render pipeline. 


Design:

1. Use Vulkan as the basic 3D graphic library and shader library
2. Add compute-shader interface
3. Provide model system with automatic trimming
4. Provide optional window system with SDL2 and IMGUI library
5. UTF-8 and custom font support
